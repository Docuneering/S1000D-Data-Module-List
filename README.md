# S1000D-dmRef-List

The `dmRefList.vbs` script file will read through a folder and where it finds an S1000D XML Data Module file, it will create the required `dmRef` structure and save it into a new XML file called `dmRefList.xml`.

The resultant `dmRefList.xml` file, when opened in XML Notepad, allows you to drag-and-drop the required `dmRef` structure into your S1000D Publication Module file.

The `dmRefList.xml` file is a disposable file and can be deleted after you have finished building your S1000D Publication Module.
